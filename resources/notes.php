<?php
$data;
// This file contains notes

// displaying data in core PHP

// echo "Data Displaying!";


// In Blade.php

// {{$data}};  -> it prints data in blade file
// {!! $data !!};  -> it also prints data in blade file but difference b/w those two are that this one if there is any html tag it encodes it and applied but {{$data}},this syntax will write tags as syntax instead of applying.
